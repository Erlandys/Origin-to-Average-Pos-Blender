Adds new function, which allows moving object origin to middle of selected vertices/faces/edges, while being in edit mode.

Can be found while being in edit mode: Right Click -> Origin to middle of selected or by search, using F3.

No default shortcut mapped, can bind key using Edit -> Preferences -> Keymap and looking for `Origin to middle`
